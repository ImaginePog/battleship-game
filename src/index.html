          Arrange ships on the board each ship occupies a number of consecutive
          squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The
          number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of ship. The
          ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square
          in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for
          each player. Click on other player's board and sink all their ships to
          win.
